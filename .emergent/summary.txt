The AI engineer's work primarily involved a reactive cycle of bug fixing and feature enhancement based on user reports. Initial efforts focused on fixing authentication (bcrypt incompatibility,  bug), refactoring video calls to Jitsi, and improving notification and admin functionalities. After a comprehensive summary claiming resolution, the user reported new dashboard update and call handling issues, leading to the involvement of a . The agent identified deeper issues like silent WebSocket disconnections, frontend race conditions, and missing server-side call redial logic. The engineer then meticulously implemented fixes for these root causes, including enhancing WebSocket stability, adding call tracking and redialing, improving error handling, and debouncing dashboard updates. The trajectory concludes with a successful backend test of these critical fixes, awaiting user verification or frontend testing.

<product_requirements>
The telehealth MVP is a responsive, tablet-optimized application (FastAPI, React, MongoDB) supporting Provider, Doctor, and Admin roles with secure authentication. It manages appointments (emergency/non-emergency, CRUD) and utilizes Jitsi Meet for video calls, replacing a problematic WebRTC implementation. A WebSocket-based real-time notification system provides auto-refresh and ringing popups. Recent branding enhancements include Greenstar, robust admin CRUD for users/appointments, and CSV export. The refined appointment workflow involves doctors sending notes and providers managing appointments. Key requirements include PWA conversion, multi-device accessibility with a WhatsApp-like calling experience, comprehensive notifications with categories (All, Calls, Appointments, Unread), provider-specific appointment filtering, real-time dashboard updates for both roles, and automatic call redialing if a call ends.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a client-server architecture with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : Core FastAPI app.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes API endpoints, authentication, user/appointment management, and WebSocket communication.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored video call logic to Jitsi URLs; enhanced notification models/endpoints; modified appointment visibility queries; improved user/appointment deletion logic; temporarily disabled push notifications due to  issues; increased JWT token expiration to 8 hours; added  endpoint; fixed  to log errors instead of silently failing; implemented WebSocket heartbeat; added call tracking for ,  with redial logic.
-   : Handles client-side routing and authentication context.
    -   **Importance**: Entry point for React app, manages global state, authentication, and routing.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed a bug clearing  (initially, then confirmed it was not present later); added Axios response interceptor for graceful 401 error handling.
-   : Provider's dashboard.
    -   **Importance**: Displays provider-specific appointments, notifications, and call options.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  for Jitsi; integrated  and ; added appointment cancellation functionality; enhanced WebSocket handling for notifications/auto-refresh with reconnection logic and error handling; improved  with robust error handling; fixed WebSocket reconnection logic.
-   : Doctor's dashboard.
    -   **Importance**: Displays doctor-specific appointments (pending), and call options.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  for Jitsi; integrated  and ; fixed  redeclaration; enhanced WebSocket handling for  notifications and auto-refresh with reconnection logic and error handling; improved , ,  with better error handling and user feedback; implemented debounced refresh.
-   : Admin interface.
    -   **Importance**: Provides CRUD operations for users and appointments.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed  and  for proper UI refresh; added a Clean All Appointments button linked to the new backend endpoint.
-   : **NEW FILE**.
    -   **Importance**: Implements a comprehensive notification UI with various tabs and direct calling options.
    -   **Changes**: Added robust error handling, data validation, and storage limits to prevent crashes; enhanced  and  functions.
-   : **NEW FILE**.
    -   **Importance**: Component for direct calls.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced with automatic redialing logic (up to 3 attempts with 30-second delays) and visual feedback.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Styling for the application.
    -   **Changes**: Added CSS for danger buttons and responsive design for 10-inch Android tablets.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing recurring critical issues related to dashboard updates, call handling, and session persistence, guided by a 's root cause analysis.

The user reported:
1.  **Doctor/Provider Dashboards Issues**: Sections like Pending Requests, My Appointments, Todays Activity", "Todays Summary are not updating or working properly.
2.  **Call Handling Issue**: Provider does not receive incoming call notification or redial attempts once a call ends.

The AI engineer implemented the following specific fixes:
-   **Backend WebSocket ConnectionManager**: Fixed  to log errors instead of silently disconnecting users during , enhancing WebSocket stability.
-   **WebSocket Heartbeat**: Added a heartbeat mechanism in  to maintain active WebSocket connections.
-   **Frontend Dashboard Race Conditions**: Modified  to use a debounced refresh mechanism within  instead of multiple  calls, preventing update conflicts.
-   **Server-Side Call End Detection and Notification**: Implemented call tracking and redialing logic in  within  and  endpoints. This includes detecting call endings, initiating redials (up to 3 times with 30-second delays), and sending retry notifications to providers.
-   **Call Redialing Logic**: Enhanced  to support automatic redialing attempts (up to 3 times with 30-second delays) and visual feedback for the user.
-   **WebSocket Reconnection Logic**: Enhanced WebSocket implementation in  and  with improved reconnection logic and error handling.

The latest backend testing () indicates that these critical fixes for WebSocket connections, heartbeat, call management (auto-redial, end detection), and dashboard data updates (role-based filtering, real-time notifications, debounced refresh) are functioning as expected. The system now reports 14 total appointments, with 8 emergency cases.
