The AI engineer's work involved an iterative development and bug-fixing process for a full-stack telehealth MVP. Initial efforts focused on PWA conversion, implementing , , and push notifications. Key challenges included establishing reliable video communication, leading to a migration from WebRTC to Jitsi Meet. The engineer systematically addressed user feedback regarding Android PWA layout, auto-login, admin CRUD functionalities, and video call reconnection. Repeatedly, critical issues stemmed from the deployment environment, particularly incorrect frontend  configurations and a persistent Spinning up Servers overlay from the Emergent platform blocking app interaction. Despite numerous code fixes to the application logic (e.g.,  bug, auth headers, responsive CSS), the fundamental deployment issue persisted, preventing full end-to-end testing and causing login failures on external devices. The work concluded with the identification of this environment-level problem.

<product_requirements>
The initial goal was to build a responsive, tablet-optimized telehealth MVP using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. Core features included user management (Provider, Doctor, Admin), secure authentication, comprehensive appointment management (creation, acceptance, completion for emergency/non-emergency), WebRTC video calling, and WebSocket-based real-time notifications.

Subsequent enhancements and bug fixes iteratively refined the platform:
- Branding: Integrated Greenstar branding and removed Emergent branding.
- Admin Controls: Robust admin-only access for user CRUD and reporting.
- Export: CSV export for appointments, users, and reports.
- Appointment Workflow: Doctors send notes to providers, providers manage their appointments, admins have full CRUD access.
- Video Calls: Persistent issues with WebRTC connectivity led to a complete migration to Jitsi Meet for improved reliability and features.
- Notifications: Auto-refresh for appointments and real-time ringing popups with patient details were implemented.
- Mobile Accessibility: The user requested the app be available on the Play Store, leading to the current task of converting it to a Progressive Web App (PWA).

<code_architecture>
The application employs a client-server architecture with a React frontend and FastAPI backend, using MongoDB as the database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : Core FastAPI application. Refactored from WebRTC to Jitsi. Added push notification models/endpoints, integrated them into video call flow, implemented a comprehensive user edit endpoint (), and introduced a  endpoint.
-   : Client-side routing, auth context. Modified for PWA service worker registration, push notification initialization, and to clear stored user data. Adjusted loading state and added timeouts for robustness.
-   : Provider's dashboard.  adapted for Jitsi and mobile compatibility using . Enhanced WebSocket handling and reconnection logic. Fixed notification sound trigger by incorporating user interaction for audio permission. Integrated  and improved mobile responsiveness.
-   : Doctor's interface.  function updated to be mobile-friendly for Jitsi calls.
-   : Admin interface. Fixed user deletion and implemented a full user edit functionality ( with ), ensuring all API calls included proper Authorization headers.
-   : PWA metadata. Created and updated with appropriate icons and Android compatibility settings.
-   : PWA service worker. Created, had lint errors fixed, and was enhanced for offline caching and mobile-specific issues.
-   : A Python script, created to programmatically generate PWA icons of various sizes, necessitating the installation of the  library.
-   : Manages push notification subscriptions. A critical bug related to  method binding was identified and fixed, and its initialization logic was refined.
-   : Global styles. Extensively updated with mobile-specific media queries, PWA-specific styles, safe area support, and navigation adjustments for improved responsiveness. A  property was added to  to attempt to render the app above deployment overlays.
-   : Frontend environment variables. Repeatedly identified as having incorrect  configurations, which significantly hampered frontend-backend connectivity in the deployed environment.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Resolve the persistent deployment issue where the external URL serves an iframe wrapper or Spinning up Servers overlay, preventing direct app interaction and full end-to-end testing.
- Ensure consistent login functionality across all devices without credential errors, which is currently blocked by the deployment issue.
- Verify that all implemented fixes (e.g., admin CRUD, video call reconnection, notification sounds, responsive design) are fully functional and accessible in the deployed environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was critically investigating the app's persistent failure to log in or function on external devices, frequently showing credential error messages or being stuck on a Spinning up Servers overlay.

The core problem was identified as a combination of:
1.  **Incorrect Frontend Backend URL Configuration**: The  in  was repeatedly found to be misconfigured or reverted, preventing the frontend from reaching the backend.
2.  **Deployment Environment Instability**: The external preview URL was serving an iframe wrapper (either Spinning up Servers or Preview Unavailable messages) instead of the direct React application. This deployment-level overlay was physically blocking user interaction, even when the underlying React app was technically loading correctly.
3.  **App Inactivity Shutdown**: The investigation culminated in the discovery that the Emergent platform itself was putting the application to sleep after inactivity, requiring a manual wake-up as indicated by a Preview Unavailable message.

The engineer's latest attempts to resolve this included:
-   Correcting the  in  to match the correct backend service URL.
-   Adding a  to the  element in  to try and force the React app to render above any deployment overlays.
-   Debugging the app's loading state in  and adding timeouts to ensure independent loading.

The current state is that the React app *is* loading the login form correctly, but the external Spinning up Servers overlay originating from the deployment infrastructure is still blocking user interaction, indicating a fundamental deployment-level issue rather than an application code bug.

Communicate the deployment environment issue to the user, explaining the external Spinning up Servers overlay and the platform's inactivity shutdown.
