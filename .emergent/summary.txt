The trajectory details an extensive, iterative development process to enhance a telehealth MVP. Initially, the AI debugged user-reported issues that were mostly environment-related. The focus then shifted to implementing complex features: enhanced admin controls, accurate appointment visibility, and actionable notifications. Subsequent user feedback revealed critical problems with real-time sync, call functionality (Jitsi moderator), background service persistence, and a flawed notes system. The AI made multiple attempts to resolve these, often facing frontend caching issues, syntax errors, and persistent deployment discrepancies. A significant turning point involved diagnosing hardcoded preview URLs and mobile-specific code affecting laptop browsers. The trajectory concludes with the AI mid-attempt to resolve persistent real-time sync and backend password issues, indicating the ongoing challenge of achieving robust, cross-device functionality and reliable real-time updates.

<product_requirements>
The telehealth MVP, built on FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, aims to manage appointments and facilitate Jitsi video calls for Provider, Doctor, and Admin roles. Initial bug reports (dashboard failures, call redialing, admin CRUD) were resolved as non-issues.

Current explicit requirements from the user include:
-   **Notes Feature**: Doctors and Providers must reliably send/receive notes for both emergency/non-emergency appointments without app crashes, with real-time delivery and display in notifications.
-   **Real-Time Updates**: Appointments, notes, users, and deletions must reflect instantly across Doctor, Provider, and Admin interfaces without requiring logout/login.
-   **Notifications**: Must display full details (appointment info, sender, note text), be clickable to navigate to relevant activities, and persist.
-   **Refresh Button**: Must be removed as real-time sync is expected.
-   **Background Agent**: Must remain online and active to prevent missed updates (using foreground service, WorkManager, or Firebase messaging).
-   **Appointment Deletion Rules**: Only doctors can delete appointments; providers must not see or access the delete option.
-   **Admin Password Issue**: Admin panel must display the correct custom password for new users, not a hardcoded default.
-   **Area of Consultation**: Update to a specific list of 27+ medical specialties.
-   **Cross-Device Compatibility**: The application must function consistently across all devices and browsers, not just the preview environment.
-   **Jitsi Call Issue**: Calls should not show Waiting for moderator; the initiator should automatically be the moderator. WhatsApp-like re-calling.
-   **Vitals**: Add Hb and Sugar Level fields to patient vitals.
-   **UI Changes**: Replace Consultation Reason with History, add Area of Consultation textbox (dropdown), add icons for vitals, and appointment type indicators (red for emergency, green/blue for non-emergency).

<current_work>
The most recent work involved addressing a series of user-reported issues related to the telehealth application's core functionality. The user repeatedly stated that real-time updates were not working, the backend password display was incorrect, and notifications were not fully detailed. The agent was attempting to fix these for the third time.

Specifically:
1.  **Removing Refresh Button**: The agent successfully removed the manual Refresh button from  and  as it was deemed unnecessary with expected real-time updates.
2.  **Fixing Backend Password Issue**: The agent diagnosed that the backend was hashing passwords correctly but not storing the plain text version needed for admin viewing. The plan was to modify the user creation logic in  to store the plain text password alongside the hashed password. The agent modified the  endpoint in  to store both  and .
3.  **Fixing Real-Time Sync**: The user claimed real-time updates were still not working despite previous attempts. The agent was investigating the WebSocket system, specifically checking the  method in  to understand why connections might not be established properly or if the broadcast mechanism itself was faulty. The trajectory ends with the agent in the middle of this investigation, attempting to understand the WebSocket manager implementation.
