# 🔔 Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Setup Guide

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

All Firebase Cloud Messaging code has been implemented! The system is ready to send real-time push notifications for:
- New appointments
- Emergency bookings  
- Doctor/Provider notes
- Incoming video calls

---

## 🚀 FINAL SETUP STEPS (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (FREE)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click "Add Project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., "telehealth-app")
4. Disable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create Project"

### Step 2: Get Web Configuration

1. In Firebase Console, click ⚙️ (Settings) → Project Settings
2. Scroll down to "Your apps"
3. Click "</>" (Web icon)
4. Register app (name: "Telehealth Web")
5. Copy the firebaseConfig object

### Step 3: Get VAPID Key

1. In Firebase Console → Project Settings
2. Click "Cloud Messaging" tab
3. Scroll to "Web Push certificates"
4. Click "Generate key pair"
5. Copy the generated key

### Step 4: Get Server Key

1. Still in "Cloud Messaging" tab
2. Find "Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)"
3. Click "⋮" → "Manage API in Google Cloud Console"
4. Enable "Cloud Messaging API"
5. Go back to Firebase → Cloud Messaging
6. Copy "Server key"

### Step 5: Update Frontend Config

**File**: `/app/frontend/src/firebase-config.js`

Replace the demo values:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",  // From Step 2
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",  // From Step 2
  projectId: "your-project-id",  // From Step 2
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",  // From Step 2
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",  // From Step 2
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef",  // From Step 2
  measurementId: "G-XXXXXXXXXX"  // From Step 2 (optional)
};

const vapidKey = "YOUR_VAPID_KEY_HERE";  // From Step 3
```

**File**: `/app/frontend/public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`

Update the same config (lines 7-13):

```javascript
firebase.initializeApp({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef"
});
```

### Step 6: Setup Backend (Optional - For Advanced Features)

Download Service Account JSON:
1. Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
2. Click "Generate New Private Key"
3. Save as `firebase-service-account.json`
4. Place in `/app/backend/`
5. Add to `.env`: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/backend/firebase-service-account.json`

OR skip this step - basic FCM will work without it!

### Step 7: Restart Services

```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend
sudo supervisorctl restart backend
```

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test 1: Request Permission

1. Login to the app
2. Browser will show: "Allow notifications?"
3. Click "Allow"
4. Console should show: "✅ FCM initialized successfully"

### Test 2: Create Appointment (Provider)

1. Login as Provider
2. Create new appointment
3. **Check Doctor's browser** (even if closed):
   - Notification appears with patient details
   - Click notification → Opens appointment

### Test 3: Send Note

1. Doctor sends note to Provider
2. **Check Provider's browser**:
   - Notification appears
   - Click → Opens note

### Test 4: Video Call

1. Doctor initiates video call
2. **Check Provider's browser** (even if in background):
   - Notification appears: "📞 Incoming Call"
   - Click → Joins call

- `/app/frontend/public/firebase-messaging-sw.js` - Service worker for background notifications

### ✅ Backend Files:
- `/app/backend/fcm_service.py` - FCM notification sending service
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Updated with FCM endpoints & notifications

### ✅ Features Ready:
- Token registration on login
- Push notifications for all appointment types
- Background notifications (app closed)
- Foreground notifications (app open)
- Click-to-navigate (opens relevant screens)
- Console logging for debugging

## 🔍 CONSOLE LOGS TO EXPECT

**Frontend (Browser Console)**:
```
✅ Firebase initialized successfully
🔑 FCM Token obtained: BPvZ9... (truncated)
✅ FCM token saved to backend
🔔 [Foreground] Message received: {...}
📱 [Foreground] Showing notification: New Appointment
```

**Service Worker (Browser Console → Application → Service Workers)**:

## 🎉 CURRENT STATUS

**Frontend**: ✅ RUNNING with Firebase SDK
**Backend**: ✅ RUNNING with FCM endpoints
**Service Worker**: ✅ REGISTERED
**Notifications**: ⏳ READY (needs your Firebase config)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Demo Credentials**: The system has demo credentials. Replace them with your real Firebase config for notifications to work.

2. **Service Worker**: Already registered at `/firebase-messaging-sw.js`

3. **HTTPS Required**: FCM requires HTTPS (your preview URL already has it ✅)

4. **Browser Support**: 
   - Chrome: ✅
   - Firefox: ✅
   - Safari: ✅ (iOS 16.4+)
   - Edge: ✅

5. **Free Tier**: Firebase FCM is FREE with unlimited notifications!

## 🆘 NEED HELP?

If you need help setting up Firebase, just say:
- "Help me create Firebase project"
- "Show me where to find API keys"
- "How do I test notifications?"

**System is 99% complete - just add your Firebase config and you're live! 🚀**
