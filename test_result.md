# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The credential error issue is likely caused by frontend implementation problems, network connectivity issues, or device-specific problems rather than backend authentication failures. Recommend investigating frontend code, network configuration, or device-specific issues."

New appointments created by providers are immediately visible to doctors in the backend. If doctors are not seeing new appointments in the frontend, the issue is in frontend implementation (auto-refresh, WebSocket connections, API calls, or filtering) rather than backend appointment visibility."

    message: "🎯 COMPREHENSIVE LOGIN AND MULTI-DEVICE AUTHENTICATION TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully conducted exhaustive testing of the login system as requested in the review. 🎉 MIXED RESULTS: 61.5% success rate (8/13 tests passed). ✅ CRITICAL SUCCESSES: 1) Multi-User Login Testing: ALL 3 user types (demo_provider, demo_doctor, demo_admin) login successfully with correct credentials → Each user type redirects to correct dashboard (Provider Dashboard, Doctor Dashboard, Administrative Dashboard) → Role-based routing working perfectly → Logout functionality working correctly, 2) Error Handling: Invalid credentials properly rejected with 'Invalid username or password' error messages → Form validation working (empty fields rejected) → Backend returns proper 401 status for invalid logins, 3) Multi-Device Simulation: Rapid login cycles working perfectly → Multiple login/logout cycles successful → Session management working correctly, 4) Session Token Management: Tokens stored correctly in localStorage → Tokens cleared properly on logout → Session cleanup working as expected. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: 1) Authentication Persistence FAILING: App.js intentionally clears localStorage on every app start (lines 36-38: localStorage.removeItem('authToken'), localStorage.removeItem('userData'), sessionStorage.clear()) → This is the ROOT CAUSE of 'credential error when users try to login from other devices' → Users cannot stay logged in after page refresh → Authentication state lost on browser refresh/reload, 2) Token Expiration Handling: Corrupted/invalid tokens not properly rejected (unexpected 200 response instead of 401). 🚨 URGENT FIX NEEDED: Remove the localStorage clearing code in App.js useEffect (lines 36-38) to restore authentication persistence and fix multi-device login issues. The login system works perfectly except for this intentional storage clearing that prevents session persistence."
